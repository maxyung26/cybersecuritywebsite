throughout these pages of this website, there have been mentions of different types of cybersecurity threats and attacks. this page will sum all of them up
<li>social engineering: also known as a phishing attack, this cyberattack actually contains no malware and decieves the victim into giving their personal information and details to a dangerous individual or group by pretending to be someone they aren't</li>
<li>weak passwords: passwords that are common with few characters can be easily cracked with brute-forcing programs such as john the ripper. these passwords are vulnerable and susceptible to attacks by blackhat hackers giving them easy access to your accounts and data</li>
<li>malware: what most people think of when they think about hacking, malware is a program designed specifically to either steal, damage, or destroy data from a user</li>
<li>ransomware: similar to malware, this program denies a user from their data. however, once they user pays a ransom to the cybercriminal, they would be able to access their data again</li>
