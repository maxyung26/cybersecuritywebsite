the cia triad stands for confidentiality, integrity, and avaliablity. these 3 things are why we have cybersecurity.
<li>confidentiality makes sure data is not revealed <ul> ex: a game company wants to release a game on the 17th, a confidentiality attack would leak the release date of the game<ul>NSA leaks of government data by Edward Snowden</ul></ul></li>
<li>integrity makes sure data is intact - not modified or corrupted <ul> ex: someone sends an email to someone about the release date of the game, which is the 17th. an integrity attack would be if someone intercepted the email and changed the 17th to the 21st<ul>STUXNet worm - changed code in Iranian nuclear facility so they ran at too high of a speed</ul></ul></li>
<li>avaliablity makes sure data is accessible to allowed users <ul> ex: someone sends an email to someone about the release date of the game, but the recipient of the email never recieves the information<ul>Mirai Botnet takes down website of cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs</ul></ul></li>
