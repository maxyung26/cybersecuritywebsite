phishing is a type of cyberattack where someone pretends to be someone they aren't to gain your personal details and information
<br>
even though phishing is considered one of the top 4 biggest cybersecurity threats, it doesn't have malware, it is just a hacker impersonating someone else
<br>
ways to identify a phishing attack include:
<li>emails from an "official" organization with poor grammar</li>
<li>text or calls from an imposter from a number that doesn't belong to the company they say they're from</li>
<li>fishy links sent to you by via email or text that have a suspicious link</li>
